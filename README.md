🚗 Uber Trip Analysis – Forecasting Daily Uber Trip Demand
📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting daily Uber trip demand using machine learning. Utilizing historical data from January and February 2015, the project aims to predict the number of Uber trips per day based on time-based features and historical trip trends.

Accurately forecasting ride demand enables companies like Uber to optimize vehicle allocation, reduce customer wait times, and improve driver efficiency.

📂 Dataset Details
Dataset Name: Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv

Source: FOIL response data from Uber NYC

Time Period Covered: January–February 2015

Size: Daily records over ~60 days

Columns:

date: The date of the trip data

active_vehicles: Total Uber vehicles active on that day

trips: Total number of completed Uber trips

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Category	Tools/Technologies

Data Manipulation	Pandas, NumPy
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning	Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
Environment	Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze trends in daily Uber trips.

Identify patterns based on day of the week and vehicle count.

Use lag features (previous day’s trip count) to predict future trips.

Train and evaluate a Random Forest Regressor for accurate forecasting.

Visualize and compare actual vs predicted trips.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several charts and graphs were created to understand the data better:

Daily Trip Volume – A line chart showing Uber trips each day.

Trips by Day of the Week – Identified busy days (e.g., Fridays, weekends).

Trips by Month – January vs February comparison.

Key insights:

Trip demand varied significantly based on the day of the week.

More active vehicles usually led to more trips.

Past trip counts are useful predictors for future demand.

🧠 Feature Engineering
To make accurate predictions, the following features were created:

DayOfWeek: Extracted from date (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)

Month: Extracted from date

trips_lag1: Trip count 1 day ago

trips_lag2: Trip count 2 days ago

These features help the model understand temporal patterns in trip data.

🤖 Model Development
Model Used: Random Forest Regressor

Reason: Handles non-linear relationships and is robust for small datasets.

Model Training Steps:
Split data into training and testing sets (80/20).

Train the model on training data using:

active_vehicles

day_of_week

month

trips_lag1

trips_lag2

Predict trips on test data.

Evaluate using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score.

📈 Model Performance
Metric	Result (Example)
Mean Absolute Error	~1200 trips
R² Score	~0.94

Interpretation: The model predicted daily Uber trips with high accuracy, with very low average error.

📊 Results Visualization
A scatter plot was used to compare Actual vs Predicted Trips.

Dots close to the diagonal indicate good predictions.

Small variance shows low error and reliable model performance.


✅ Key Takeaways
Historical trip data and vehicle count are strong indicators of future demand.

Lag features significantly improved the prediction accuracy.

The project demonstrates the real-world application of machine learning in transportation and logistics.
